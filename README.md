# simple-qualtrics

Designed to be used with Qualtrics' Flat layout. 

This CSS reverts Qualtrics' unusable and odd custom UI widgets for standard radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. Unlike the Simple layout, which currently does not allow per-question Javascript, this CSS will have the look and feel of Simple but – because it's used with Flat – will still allow you to include per-question Javascript.

Include the CSS by entering this URL to the file in the Qualtrics "External CSS" field (Look and feel > Style):
